The Simplest possible "*Blogging Platform*" would be a flat-file.
Why do we need to build a blog? Simple: to share our thoughts/ideas/progress
and show others our progress along the way.

Right now I'm in Palma. Offline. Nobody is awake. Thinking time.
Tried to figure out how to read the Node.js (Core) API from CLI...

```bash
node --help
```

**utterly useless**! no "*man(ual)*" page with API methods. :-(
Most of the PDF Books I brought with me are useless 
when it comes to the CORE nodejs API. :-(
(I'm *specifically* looking for the assert module)
... professional_node.js.pdf page 160 :-)

Need to develop a simple TDD Tutorial using CoffeeScript and Jasmine.
See: https://trello.com/c/1nDvoRml/

I like Mark Pilgrim's Dive Into Python Roman Numerals Tutorials but 
I prefer something a bit more "real-world" ...

Tried including jasmine.js in an HTML file and run an *expect(3).toEqual(2)*
it fails silently. (i.e. no console output after failed expectation) :-(
